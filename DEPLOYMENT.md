# ðŸš€ Deployment Guide

## Vercel Deployment (Recommended)

### Step 1: Prepare Your Repository
1. Push your code to a GitHub repository
2. Ensure all files are committed and pushed

### Step 2: Deploy to Vercel
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign up/login
2. Click "New Project"
3. Import your GitHub repository
4. Vercel will automatically detect Next.js and configure the build settings
5. Click "Deploy"

### Step 3: Configure Domain (Optional)
1. In your Vercel dashboard, go to your project
2. Navigate to "Settings" â†’ "Domains"
3. Add your custom domain
4. Configure DNS settings as instructed

## Environment Variables
No environment variables are required for this demo application. If you add external APIs or services later, you can configure them in the Vercel dashboard under "Settings" â†’ "Environment Variables".

## Build Configuration
The project includes a `vercel.json` file with optimal settings:
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Output directory: `.next`
- Framework: Next.js
- Function timeout: 30 seconds

## Performance Optimization
- Static pages are pre-rendered for optimal performance
- Dynamic routes are server-rendered on demand
- Images are optimized automatically
- CSS is minified and optimized

## Monitoring
- Vercel provides built-in analytics
- Check "Analytics" tab in your Vercel dashboard
- Monitor Core Web Vitals and performance metrics

## Troubleshooting
- If build fails, check the build logs in Vercel dashboard
- Ensure all dependencies are in `package.json`
- Verify TypeScript compilation passes locally
- Check for any environment variable requirements

## Alternative Platforms
The app can also be deployed to:
- **Netlify**: Similar process, supports Next.js
- **Railway**: Good for full-stack applications
- **DigitalOcean App Platform**: Enterprise-grade hosting
- **AWS Amplify**: AWS integration

## Local Testing

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```
